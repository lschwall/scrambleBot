>     - Please keep in mind the smaller you make the browser window, the harder the text will be to read.

> #### In Chat
> - [ ] Use ```!guess <word>``` to submit a guess to solve the scrambled word
>   - If the user is correct it will auto update the winner, reset the scrambled word to another word, and confirm the winner in chat automatically
>   - If the user is not correct, the bot will respond in chat that the guess is not correct
> - [ ] Use ```!skip``` to vote to skip current word
>   - if  the user types this command, the vote will go up by 1. 
>   - When the voteCount reaches 3, the word will be re-scrambled!
> - [ ] Use ```!color <color> or <rgb(#,#,#)> or <hexcode>``` to change the color of the game!
>   - When the user types the command followed by a color, hexcode, or rgb(#,#,#), it will change the color of the game!
>   - If the user wants to reset the color of the game back to the original, type ```!color reset```
